CrediChain is a decentralized credential verification system that allows users to securely request, approve, share, and verify credentials using blockchain technology. It eliminates intermediaries, ensuring trustless and tamper-proof verification.


🚀 How It Works

Request Credentials – Users request credentials from verifiers.

Approve & Issue – Verifiers approve requests and issue credentials.

Share Credentials – Users share verified credentials with employers or organizations.

Verify Credentials – Employers validate authenticity via the blockchain.


🔑 Key Features

✅ Blockchain Security – Credentials are immutable and tamper-proof.

✅ Instant Verification – Eliminates manual background checks.

✅ Decentralized Sharing – Users control access to their credentials.

✅ Smart Contract Automation – Securely manages issuance and approvals.
